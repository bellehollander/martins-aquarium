              <p>When traveling to foreign countries to harvest fish, remember to have a checklist 
                of things you need to bring.
                 </p>
                 <p>budget is the first thing to consider when deciding where to go.
                   Once you know how much money you have allotted for your trip,
                    do some research into your top three destinations to figure out the total costs of airfare, 
                    accommodations and diving for your entire stay.
                   </p>
                    <p>Make sure you have the right tools required with you to safely bring the fish home.
